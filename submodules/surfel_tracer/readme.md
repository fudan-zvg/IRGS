# 2D Gaussian Ray Tracer

An OptiX-based differentiable 2D Gaussian Ray Tracer, which is the cuda backend of [IRGS](https://github.com/fudan-zvg/IRGS).

### Install
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/fudan-zvg/surfel_tracer.git
cd surfel_tracer

# use cmake to build the project for ptx file (for Optix)
rm -rf ./build && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && cd ../

# Install the package
pip install .
```

### Example usage
See `surfel_tracer/raytracer.py` for the usage of the 2D Gaussian Ray Tracer. You can also refer to [IRGS](https://github.com/fudan-zvg/IRGS).
